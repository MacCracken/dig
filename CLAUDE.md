## Project Identity

**dig** — sovereign Cyrius reimplementation of BIND's `dig`. DNS resolver. **Cultural double-anchor**: mechanically *Domain Information Groper* (the upstream BIND meaning); culturally *Cyrus from The Warriors (1979) — "Can you dig it?"* — consonant with **Cyrius**, the language. Two layers of dig in one verb.

- **Type**: Binary (CLI tool)
- **License**: GPL-3.0-only
- **Language**: Cyrius (toolchain pinned in `cyrius.cyml [package].cyrius`)
- **Version**: `VERSION` at the project root is the source of truth — do not inline the number here
- **Genesis repo**: [agnosticos](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos)
- **Standards**: [First-Party Standards](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/first-party/first-party-standards.md) · [First-Party Documentation](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/first-party/first-party-documentation.md)
- **Shared crates**: [shared-crates.md](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/planning/shared-crates.md)

## Goal

Own the **DNS-resolver surface** in the AGNOS network-tools family: A / AAAA / MX / TXT / NS / CNAME / SOA / SRV / PTR queries against arbitrary resolvers, with `+short` / `+trace` / `+tcp` / `+dnssec` flag aesthetics from upstream BIND. Cyrius-native, no POSIX `socket()` — consumes the kernel's sovereign `udp_send` / `udp_recv` / `tcp_connect` primitives per the kernel-grows-for-native-workloads rule.

**Strategic position — extraction trigger for `taar`**. Second entry in the network-tools family (after `yo`); the duplication friction between yo (ICMP) and dig (DNS + UDP/TCP-53 sockets — orthogonal protocol surface) is what shapes taar's API honestly. Per user direction 2026-05-23: yo → dig → extract taar (at dig completion) → whirl consumes already-extracted taar. The three-consumer brainstorm window (yo + dig + whirl) pins taar's eventual scope; dig completion is the extraction trigger. Same shape as mihi → iam/chakshu (2026-05-20).

## Current State

> Volatile state lives in [`docs/development/state.md`](docs/development/state.md) —
> current version, surface area, in-flight work, consumers, dep gaps.
> Refreshed every release.

This file (`CLAUDE.md`) is durable rules.

## Scaffolding

Project was scaffolded with `cyrius init` (greenfield) or `cyrius port` (Rust → Cyrius migration). **Do not manually create project structure** — use the tools. If a tool is missing something, fix the tool.

## Quick Start

```sh
cyrius deps                          # resolve sibling deps
cyrius build src/main.cyr build/dig
cyrius test                          # run [build].test + tests/*.tcyr
```

## Key Principles

- **Correctness over cleverness** — if it's wrong, the bugs own you
- Test after every change, not after the feature is "done"
- ONE change at a time — never bundle unrelated changes
- Research before implementation — check vidya / existing patterns
- Build with `cyrius build`, not raw `cat file | cc5` — the manifest auto-resolves deps and prepends includes
- Source files only need project includes — stdlib / external deps auto-resolve from `cyrius.cyml`
- Every buffer declaration is a contract: `var buf[N]` = N **bytes**, not N entries
- `&&` / `||` short-circuit; mixed expressions require explicit parens

## Rules (Hard Constraints)

- **Do not commit or push** — the user handles all git operations
- **Never use `gh` CLI** — use `curl` to the GitHub API if needed
- Do not skip tests before claiming changes work
- Do not use `sys_system()` with unsanitized input — command injection
- Do not trust external data (file / network / args) without validation
- Do not modify `lib/` files (vendored stdlib / dep symlinks)
- Do not hardcode toolchain versions in CI YAML — `cyrius = "X.Y.Z"` in `cyrius.cyml` is the source of truth

## Documentation

- [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — Architecture Decision Records (*why X over Y?*)
- [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) — Non-obvious constraints (*what's true about the code?*)
- [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/) — Task-oriented how-tos
- [`docs/examples/`](docs/examples/) — Runnable examples
- [`docs/development/state.md`](docs/development/state.md) — Live state snapshot
- [`docs/development/roadmap.md`](docs/development/roadmap.md) — Milestones through v1.0

## Process

1. **Work phase** — features, roadmap items, bug fixes
2. **Build check** — `cyrius build`
3. **Test + benchmark additions** for new code
4. **Internal review** — performance, memory, correctness, edge cases
5. **Documentation** — update CHANGELOG, `docs/development/state.md`, any ADR the change earned
6. **Version sync** — `VERSION`, `cyrius.cyml`, CHANGELOG header
